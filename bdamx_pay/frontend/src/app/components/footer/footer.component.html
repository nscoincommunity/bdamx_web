                                    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
                                    <p>California OPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. </p>     
                                    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

                                    <h4>INVESTMENT RISKS</h4>
                                    <p>Investing in BDAM is like buying a currency and holding it for some time, thinking that its value will appreciate against a particular set of currency. If the token is purchased prior to the listing of the token, then the investment is called ICO (Initial Token Offering). The investor must acknowledge and agree that the risk of such investments is never guaranteed, and after the token is listed on an exchange, its value may even drop below the initial purchase price. The Client holding the tokens purchased in the ICO must keep them for at least six months ensuring that the developer of this token has enough time to find another buyer or sell it in the exchange at its prevailing price. In case, the investor is not able to sell it in the exchange, at times a new investor may take advantage of it and will ask it a discounted rate from the market value of the token. This has nothing to do with the developer and will purely be based upon agreement of both of the parties without having any relation to the developer at all.</p>     
                                    <p>The investment in BDAM token can lead to loss of money over short or even long periods. Once the developers of the BDAM platform or BDAM have listed the tokens in an exchange then the value of the token will be driven by the market sentiment. The investors in BDAM token should expect prices to have large range fluctuations. The information published on the Website cannot guarantee that the investors in BDAM token would not lose money.</p>

                                    <h4>RISK OF ALTERNATIVE, UNOFFICIAL BDAM PLATFORM </h4>
                                    <p>t is possible that alternative BDAM -based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source code and open source protocol underlying the BDAM Platform.

                                    <p>The BDAM Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the BDAM or the BDAM Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the BDAM, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the BDAM Platform causing the system to lose BDAM token stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the BDAM Platform.</p>

                                    <h4>RISK OF WEAKNESSES OR EXPLOITABLE BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE FIELD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY</h4>
                                    <p>As it is said that Cryptography is an art, not a science, and the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the BDAM Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of BDAM Token. To the extent possible, BDAM intends to update the protocol underlying the BDAM Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.</p>

                                    <h4>RISK OF RAPID ADOPTION AND INCREASED DEMAND</h4>
                                    <p>If the BDAM Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for BDAM could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which BDAM miners can create new BDAM tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire BDAM Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the BDAM Platform and BDAM. Instability in the demand of for BDAM Token or BDAM platform may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an BDAM based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation.</p>

                                    <p>We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any BDAM deposited.

                                    <h4>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h4>
                                    <p>All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of the BDAM Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be Swiss resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice -- in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court’s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant’s nomination. All nominations must be Swiss resident. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain “independent” of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be London. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of United Kingdom and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositor or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.</p>
